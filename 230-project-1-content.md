## **Breif Game Overrule**
Escape is a side scrolling platformer. Escape is 
similar to the people game, Mario, where you 
go through the level and killing enemies that 
are in your way. To win you will have to make 
it to the end of the level.

## **Game Overrule**
Escape is a variant on the iconic game series 
Mario Bros. It is a side scrolling 2D 
Platformer. The idea of Escape is to, 
shockingly enough, escape from captivity. 
This is a desktop only game. There will be a 
list of controls given to the player with the 
game theme and goal of the game, but other 
than that, the player will have to figure out 
how to beat the game and the levels on their own.
### Story
You are backpacking in South America with 
your best friend when a group of locals come 
up to you and your friend. You see that the 
locals all have weapons. They start screaming 
at you and your friend in their native 
language, that neither of you can understand. 
They start to grab a hold of both you and your 
friend. Your friend breaks away and start 
running away and a couple of the natives 
start running after him. They catch up and 
snaps his neck. Now that everyone is distracted, 
you start to make a run for it.
### Controls
Use the Left and Right arrow key to move 
forward and backward. Use the Space Bar to jump.

## **Citing**
For the images I used in this project above, I 
put links to each one on the image that leads to 
where I found them. I also used W3Schools for t
utorials to rejog my memory on the syntax on 
how to add images and links into this webpage
and other styling syntax.
